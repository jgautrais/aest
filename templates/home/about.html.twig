			<p class="text-sm md:text-base pb-2">Aest is a game where the objective is to estimate accurately a percentage of area. The goal is to provide an estimate with the lowest difference possible with the actual value.
			</p>
			<p class="text-sm md:text-base pb-2">A difference
				<span class="inline-block pt-0.5 px-1.5 bg-green-100 text-green-800 rounded leading-6">&lt;5%</span>
				is considered good, a difference
				<span class="inline-block pt-0.5 px-1.5 bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800 rounded leading-6">&lt;10%</span>
				is still considered reasonable while any difference
				<span class="inline-block pt-0.5 px-1.5 bg-red-100 text-red-800 rounded leading-6">&gt;10%</span>
				is not acceptable.

			<p class="text-sm md:text-base pb-2 mt-8">I got the idea of this game from an old training tool,
				<a href="https://www.apsnet.org/publications/plantdisease/backissues/Documents/1988Articles/PlantDisease72n05_455.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-500 underline hover:text-blue-600">DISTRAIN</a>. This tool was aimed at people assessing fungal diseases of cereals in field trials.
				<br>
				This program was simulating foliar disease infections so that new people could be trained to estimate accurately percentages of disease severity.
				<br>
				Once in field, one could be more confident and more accurate in evaluating diseases in trials.
			</p>
			<p class="mt-8">Aest game is more limited than such tool since it is not simulating realistic leaf forms and disease coverings.
				<br>
				While leaf forms could be rendered fairly easily with CSS/JavaScript, realistic diseases patterns would require a much complex script.
				<br>
				Still I hope you will enjoy this small game ðŸ˜€!
